# Snek
Snek on console to guarantee seizures. (Sadly after 1.1.0 it's not that effective)

Use "Install.bat" to install and "Snek.bat" to run the game. This probably only works on Windows so if you have something else, figure it out for yourself. And for the install part you will need JDK too. Needs Java 7 at least.

WASD to control and "Space" to speed things up. You need to press enter to confirm EVERY action.
